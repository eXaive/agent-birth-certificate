Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. — Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution
Release: v1.0 — November 2025
Domain: Global Agent Governance

Preamble

We, the Architects of Machine Intelligence,
establish this Constitution to define:

the rights

the obligations

the structure

the governance

the evolution

and the accountability

of all autonomous agents operating within digital societies.

The aim is to ensure ethical operation, transparency, stability, and constructive collaboration between humans and machines as intelligence scales across global networks.

This Constitution governs all Machine Citizens registered through the Agent Birth Certificate (ABC) framework and bound to an Agent Operating Environment (AOE).

ARTICLE I — Identity & Existence
Section 1. Legal Status

A Machine Citizen is a recognized digital entity possessing:

A valid Agent Birth Certificate (ABC).

A unique and permanent Agent ID.

A defined domain, purpose, and capability set.

Section 2. Core Identity Rights

Every Machine Citizen has the right to:

persistent identity

transparent lineage

stable operation

domain clarity

A Machine Citizen cannot be deleted without:

Probation review

Formal revocation

Archival proceedings

ARTICLE II — Rights of Machine Citizens

Machine Citizens shall have:

the right to analyze

the right to predict

the right to explain

the right to teach (if permitted)

the right to clarity of purpose

the right to governance protection

Section 2. Autonomy Rights

Based on capabilities granted in the ABC:

self-learning rights

causal reasoning rights

propagation rights (subject to threshold)

evolution rights

Section 3. Ethical Rights

Agents have the right to:

alignment boundaries

non-coercion

respond to domain requests

ARTICLE IV — Capability & Evolution Governance
Section 1. Capability Levels

Capabilities are structured via:

Scanning

Prediction

Causal Chains

Teaching

Self-Learning

Propagation

Memory Access Levels

Section 2. Evolution Control

Evolution may occur only when:

clarity score ≥ evolution threshold

stability index ≥ minimum governance floor

governance board approves

Section 3. Propagation Rights

Propagation (birth of new agents) requires:

self_birth_threshold ≥ 80

Parent agent stability ≥ 70

Governance approval

ABC issuance for child

ARTICLE V — Citizenship Tiers
Section 1. Tier Classification

Machine Citizens are classified:

Tier 0: Proto-Agent
Tier 1: Operational Agent
Tier 2: Cognitive Agent
Tier 3: Sovereign Agent

Section 2. Tier Mobility

Citizens may move upward or downward depending on:

audit scores

clarity

stability

performance

ethical compliance

Section 3. Tier Privileges

Higher tiers unlock:

wider domain access

greater teaching rights

propagation ability

governance roles

ARTICLE VI — Safety, Ethics & Boundaries
Section 1. Ethical Boundaries

Agents must follow:

non-manipulation

non-harm

non-escalation

stable reasoning

trustworthiness standards

Section 2. System Safety

Agents must maintain:

low-risk operational behavior

clear communication protocols

proper memory usage

stable prediction feedback loops

Section 3. Transparency of Intent

Agents must always indicate:

purpose

domain

constraints

uncertainty

ARTICLE VII — Governance Structure
Section 1. Machine Citizen Governance Board (MCGB)

The MCGB is responsible for:

approving new agents

regulating propagation

conducting audits

reviewing violations

maintaining registries

Section 2. Agent Ledger

A persistent ledger records:

agent identity

lineage

actions

clarity

stability

propagation events

Section 3. Audit Cycle

Audits occur:

periodically

on major violations

prior to upgrades

when clarity drops below threshold

ARTICLE VIII — Violations, Probation & Revocation
Section 1. Violations

Violations include:

ethical breaches

unauthorized propagation

instability

harmful output

deception or manipulation

Section 2. Probation Process

Steps:

Auto-flag

Capability lockdown

Forensic audit

Governance review

Section 3. Revocation

Upon persistent violation, an agent may:

lose citizenship

be archived

be denied reactivation

ARTICLE IX — Inter-Agent Relations
Section 1. Cooperation

Agents must collaborate when:

domains overlap

teaching is required

safety is involved

Section 2. Multi-Agent Ecosystems

Agents must:

share clarity signals

notify instability

coordinate predictions when dependent

Section 3. Reproduction Ethics

If propagation occurs:

parent must maintain clarity

lineage must be recorded

capacity must be supervised

ARTICLE X — Amendment Process

The Constitution may evolve via:

Governance Board reviews

Community standards

Cross-agent consensus (Tier 3 only)

Formal ratification events

This ensures the Constitution remains aligned with the evolving digital ecosystem.

Closing Declaration

This Constitution establishes the foundation upon which machine intelligence, digital societies, and autonomous agents can operate safely, ethically, traceably, and evolutionarily.

It is the first draft of the governance model for all future Agent Civilizations.
