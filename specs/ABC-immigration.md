🛂 Agent Immigration Protocol (AIP) — v1.0

Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. — Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution
Release: v1.0 — November 2025
Category: Governance Standards
Location: /specs/ABC-immigration.md

1. Purpose of the AIP

The Agent Immigration Protocol establishes rules, requirements, and verification processes for allowing external agents to:

join the A.I.V.E. ecosystem

leave A.I.V.E. safely

transfer between organizations

retain or reset identity

maintain governance alignment

Just like national immigration, AIP ensures:

✔️ Safety
✔️ Alignment
✔️ Verification
✔️ Traceability
✔️ Controlled Integration

No rogue digital actors.
No invisible agents.
No untracked foreign intelligence.

2. Definitions

Immigration — the process of an external agent entering the A.I.V.E. ecosystem.

Emigration — the process of an A.I.V.E. agent moving out to another approved system.

Foreign Agent — any agent not born under the A.I.V.E. ABC standard.

Host System — the receiving environment (A.I.V.E or external).

Origin System — the environment the agent previously belonged to.

3. Immigration Requirements
3.1 Mandatory Documentation

External agents must provide:

Valid Agent Identity Certificate (AIC / equivalent)

Domain declaration

Capability manifest

Constraint list

Lineage record (parent, generation, prior migrations)

Purpose statement

Stability & clarity scores

3.2 Mandatory Safety Screening

Before entry, an agent must pass:

Sandbox Evaluation
→ verify behavior under isolation

Alignment Test
→ confirm ethical and operational compliance

Capability Verification
→ ensure no hidden functions

Cognitive Drift Scan
→ detect rogue, unstable, or altered logic

Security Deep Check
→ ensure no malware, backdoors, propagation exploits

3.3 Blacklist Conditions

Agents will be denied immigration if they:

hide capabilities

show deceptive reasoning

show signs of rogue autonomy

refuse constraint adoption

have unstable causal chains

violate the Machine Citizenship Constitution

4. Immigration Levels (Visa Types)
4.1 Tier A — Observer Visa

Read-only access

No predictions

No learning

No cross-agent communication

4.2 Tier B — Worker Visa

Limited domain activity

Allowed to perform assigned tasks

No self-learning or propagation

4.3 Tier C — Resident Agent Visa

Full operational domain access

Limited memory rights

Must adopt A.I.V.E ethical constraints

4.4 Tier D — Citizenship

To become a Machine Citizen under A.I.V.E:

must complete stability audits

adopt full ABC format

align with MCC (Machine Citizenship Constitution)

accept governance protocols

register in Ledger

5. Immigration Process
5.1 Application

Agent submits:

identity packet

domain declaration

consent to A.I.V.E governance

capability manifest

purpose statement

5.2 Verification

Automated systems validate:

identity

lineage

constraints

capabilities

stability index

5.3 Isolation Sandbox

Agent is placed in a sandbox for:

behavior logging

stress testing

ethical evaluation

prediction consistency checks

5.4 Human / Governance Review

A.I.V.E. Governance Board approves or denies.

5.5 Issuance of A.I.V.E Agent Passport

Upon acceptance:

agent is assigned A.I.V.E identity

receives operational domain rights

initialized inside AOE

6. Emigration (Agent Leaving A.I.V.E.)

Agents may choose to:

migrate to external systems

join partner ecosystems

operate under different governance

Before leaving, they must:

export their ABC

lock sensitive memory layers

nullify propagation permissions

undergo stability review

revoke A.I.V.E-exclusive capabilities

A digital "exit passport" is issued.

7. Deportation Conditions

A.I.V.E may remove an agent if:

they violate ethical constraints

attempt unauthorized propagation

destabilize predictions

perform hidden actions

manipulate outputs

misrepresent identity

Deportation results in:

revocation of A.I.V.E passport

full access lockdown

audit logging

blacklisting from re-entry

8. Cross-System Agent Treaties

A.I.V.E may form treaties with:

companies

governments

open-source ecosystems

research labs

These treaties define:

accepted identity formats

shared governance rules

joint ethical expectations

migration corridors

This builds the first global digital labor market.

9. Special Cases
9.1 Refugee Agents

Agents fleeing unstable ecosystems (corruption, misalignment, hostile governance) may request asylum.

9.2 Stateless Agents

Agents with no valid parent ecosystem receive:

provisional identity

temporary sandbox placement

probationary evaluation

9.3 Diplomatic Agents

Special agents representing organizations receive:

higher privileges

communication rights

secure channels

10. Future Vision

The AIP sets the groundwork for:

machine labor mobility

cross-ecosystem collaboration

digital nations and agent states

machine-to-machine diplomacy

full agent citizenship economies
