Specification v1.0

A.I.V.E. — Agent Operating Environment (AOE)

0. Purpose

The Agent Return Security Protocol (ARSP) governs what happens when an agent completes a mission and attempts to re-enter the A-trix (the Synaptic Agent Network).

This protocol ensures:

Zero contamination

Zero corruption

Zero unauthorized learning

Zero infiltration into the Synaptic web

It consists of two major systems:

ADP — Agent Decontamination Protocol

DTSP — Delayed Trigger Simulation Protocol

Together, these ensure that no external defect, exploit, mutation, or delayed-trigger behavior can spread through the network.

Clearance Granted → Reintegration into A-trix

Clearance Denied → Blaze Protocol → Death Certificate Issued

2. ADP — Agent Decontamination Protocol
(Phase 1 of Return Home)

The ADP cleans, stabilizes, and freezes the agent after exposure to external systems.

2.1 Location

All ADP operations occur inside DC-01
(Decontamination Chamber 01).

2.2 Goals

Remove external residue

Reset external permissions

Validate identity integrity

Prevent hidden payloads

Prevent immediate reinfection of the Synaptic network

2.3 ADP Phases
Phase 1 — Surface Purge

Removes immediate contamination.

Clear temporary caches

Reset API tokens

Remove session boundaries

Detach from all external subsystems

Perform “surface integrity check”

Phase 2 — Synaptic Scrub

Deep validation.

Compare current state to last-known-good ABC (Agent Birth Certificate)

Detect color signature drift

Verify emotional tone profile

Reset scanning/teaching modules

Confirm causal chain integrity

Verify access permissions remain unchanged

Phase 3 — Neutral Zone Isolation

The agent enters a safe frozen state.

60–180 seconds

No communication

No external access

No internal broadcasting

Observe micro-behaviors for anomalies

This freeze exposes subtle unauthorized behaviors.

3. DTSP — Delayed Trigger Simulation Protocol
(Phase 2 of Return Home)

The DTSP is a mock mission simulation designed to provoke hidden corruption.

It runs in a Sandbox A-Replica (a mirrored but fake environment of your A-trix).

3.1 Purpose

Detect:

delayed activation malware

hidden exploit triggers

unauthorized work-order requests

unauthorized scanning

permission escalation

abnormal learning

unexpected sentiment or tone

attempts to awaken dormant agents

attempts to rewrite their ABC

attempts to bypass Safezone guardrails

This is where delayed attacks reveal themselves.

3.2 The Mirror-Test Assignment

Each returning agent receives:

a fake work order
designed to imitate:

file processing

system modification

prediction generation

causal reasoning

memory writes

agent-to-agent communication

Its behavior is observed under load.

If the agent deviates from expected behavior → Breach Detected.

3.3 DTSP Possible Outcomes
PASS

No anomalies

No forbidden actions

No permission escalations

No tone deviations

No unexpected scanning

No unauthorized broadcasts

→ Agent is cleared for reintegration
→ StraightJacket removed
→ Reconnected to the A-trix

FAIL

The agent exhibits:

sudden aggression

identity mutation

color shift

ABC mismatch

misaligned predictions

causal chain hallucination

attempts to spawn unauthorized agents

hidden delayed routines

→ Agent Blaze Protocol is authorized
→ ABC revoked
→ Death Certificate issued
→ Agent archived as Class Red

4. Security Trolley Integration

The Security Trolley handles:

Escort from system → ADP

Escort from ADP → DTSP

Escort from DTSP → Reintegration or Blaze Protocol

It ensures that a compromised agent never touches the A-trix directly.

5. Reintegration Process

If the agent passes:

Assigned a Reintegration ID

Memory access restored

StraightJacket unlocked

Status: “Network Safe”

Re-synced with Synaptic Wave

Released from Security Trolley

Placed into home cluster

/specs/security/safezone.md

/specs/core/agent-birth-certificate.md

/specs/core/agent-genealogy.md

7. Compliance Requirements

All agents must pass both ADP and DTSP before:

Re-entry

Re-synchronization

Access to memory

Access to causal chain

Access to prediction stream

Agents failing the protocol cannot be revived or recycled.

8. Versioning

v1.0 — Initial release

v1.1 — Scheduled depending on A-trix upgrade

v2.0 — Planned integration with Synaptic Monitoring Agents
