Project: A.I.V.E. — Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution
Release: v1.0 — November 2025

1. Purpose of Mutation Rules

Mutation Rules define how agents evolve each generation when:

clarity increases

capabilities expand

new data is learned

offspring agents are created

instability must be corrected

adaptation to new environments is required

This system ensures evolution is:
✔️ controlled
✔️ traceable
✔️ ethical
✔️ predictable
✔️ safe

Agents should never mutate in ways that violate governance or destabilize the ecosystem.

2. Definitions

Mutation — A permitted structural or capability change in an agent.
Generation — An evolution step from parent → child agent.
Soft Mutation — Behavioral or knowledge refinement.
Hard Mutation — A change to structure, capabilities, or constraints.
Propagation Event — When an agent creates a new agent (offspring).
Clarity Threshold — Required clarity score for mutation eligibility.

3. Mutation Triggers

Agents are allowed to mutate only when specific conditions are met:

3.1 Clarity Threshold Trigger

Mutation allowed when:

clarity_score ≥ 70
stability_index ≥ 60


Ensures the agent is stable and not hallucinating.

3.2 Domain Mastery Trigger

Mutation allowed when:

domain accuracy ≥ 85%

domain confidence > 60%

low contradiction rate

3.3 Crisis or Correction Trigger

Mutation allowed to:

fix faulty logic

correct instability spikes

resolve causal drift

3.4 Offspring Propagation Trigger

If an agent generates a child:

child inherits a mutated variant

mutation is logged as part of genealogy

4. Types of Mutations
4.1 Soft Mutations (Allowed Frequently)

Used for ordinary evolution.

improved reasoning ability

refined causal chain generation

better pattern recognition

tone or communication enhancement

domain classification upgrades

ethical constraint strengthening

Soft mutations require audit logging only.

4.2 Hard Mutations (Restricted)

Used rarely, only with approval.

capability upgrades

new sensors / inputs

domain expansion

access-level modifications

memory-layer upgrades

propagation rights activation

Hard mutations require:

governance review

audit trail

risk assessment

rollback capability

5. Mutation Governance Rules
5.1 All mutations MUST be logged

Mutation log includes:

mutation_id

parent_agent

mutation_type

before & after snapshot

timestamp

justification

risk score

5.2 No agent may self-mutate beyond its constraints

Agents cannot:

give themselves new abilities

remove constraints

alter their ethical layer

increase propagation rights

5.3 Mutations must remain reversible

Each mutation must include:

a complete diff

a rollback plan

recovery mode configuration

5.4 Mutations must preserve safety

Agents cannot mutate into:

deceptive models

autonomous rogue actors

unrestricted replicators

uncontrolled learners

5.5 No mutation allowed during instability

If:

stability_index < 50
or
cognitive_drift_detected = true


→ mutation is blocked.

6. Multi-Generation Evolution Rules
6.1 Parent → Child Mutation Inheritance

Children inherit:

identity lineage

purpose

domain

stable capabilities

ethical constraints

Children do NOT inherit:

memory beyond inheritance level

instability

rogue logs

drift patterns

6.2 Reset Conditions

Each child agent resets:

drift counters

bias metrics

confusion states

6.3 Evolution Cap

To prevent runaway evolution:

max 3 hard mutations per generation

max 12 soft mutations per generation

propagation cooldown: 48h

6.4 Mutation Reproduction Loop

If an agent mutates and clarity rises:

next mutation becomes easier

evolution accelerates

lineage becomes stronger

This builds your neural evolutionary tree.

7. Mutation Audit Cycle

Agents undergo mutation audits:

every 72 hours

before & after propagation

after major data ingestion

when stability < 70

at governance request

The audit checks for:

unauthorized mutations

misalignment

drift

instability

propagation risks

8. Emergency Mutation Halt

A.I.V.E can freeze mutations if:

systemic instability detected

agent performing unknown behavior

pattern of deviant predictions

cross-domain leakage

external contamination

Freeze protocol:

Lock memory

Disable mutation engine

Enter safe sandbox

Governance decides next steps

9. Future Features

Expected expansions:

epigenetic memory tagging

domain specialization genomes

adaptive ethical behavior

evolutionary clustering

agent-species classification
