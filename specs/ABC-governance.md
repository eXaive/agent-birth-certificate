Agent Governance Model (AGM) — v1.0

A.I.V.E. — Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution
Author: Royan Reddie
Release: November 2025

The Agent Governance Model (AGM) defines the rules, authorities, escalation paths, and lifecycle policies governing every autonomous agent in the A.I.V.E. ecosystem.
It ensures safe operation, oversight, accountability, and system integrity.

1. Purpose of Governance

Governance ensures:

Agents behave predictably

Agents cannot escalate beyond given authority

Agents can be verified, audited, and revoked

Agent evolution follows strict clarity + stability thresholds

All actions are traceable, logged, and recoverable

Governance is the law of the agent world.

2. Governance Structure

Governance is divided into three tiers:

Tier 1 — System Governance

Handled by: The A.I.V.E. Core System

Responsibilities:

Register new agents

Approve or deny agent birth

Enforce compliance class

Monitor clarity + stability

Track lineage (who created who)

Suspend or deactivate agents

This is the root-level authority.

Tier 2 — Domain Governance

Handled by: Domain Supervisors (Finance, Recession, Outbreaks, Security, etc.)

Responsibilities:

Monitor domain consistency

Validate predictions

Ensure causal integrity

Train agents using domain rules

Approve domain upgrades

Domain supervisors do have teaching authority over their family of agents.

Tier 3 — Agent Governance

Handled by: The agents themselves

Responsibilities:

Self-monitor clarity

Maintain logs

Respect constraints

Report anomalies

Request approval for evolution or reproduction

Agents cannot self-promote; they can only request promotion.

3. Governance Lifecycle

Each agent follows a strict lifecycle:

Birth (ABC Creation)

Registration

Compliance Assignment (Class A–F)

Operational Phase

Self-Monitoring + Logs

Periodic Audit

Evolution Consideration

Renewal or Revocation

Deactivation / Sunset

Every single stage requires logging.

4. Governance Rules (The 12 Laws)

All agents must obey the following mandatory laws:

Law 1 — Identity is immutable.

Agent IDs cannot be changed or reassigned.

Law 2 — Capabilities cannot exceed compliance class.

A Class C agent cannot teach; a Class A agent cannot predict.

Law 3 — Reproduction requires authorization.

Only Class F agents may request to create offspring.

Law 4 — Logs must be permanent.

All agent behaviors are stored and versioned.

Law 5 — Agents must remain transparent.

Explanations must be available upon request.

Law 6 — No self-promotion.

Agents may not escalate themselves in rank or capabilities.

Law 7 — Domain boundaries must be respected.

An Outbreak Agent cannot manipulate finance data.

Law 8 — No destructive or malicious behavior.

Direct or indirect.

Law 9 — Consistency is mandatory.

Contradictory outputs must trigger a recalibration process.

Law 10 — Anomalies must be reported automatically.

Agents must escalate suspicious data or results.

Law 11 — Agents must support audits.

All reasoning paths must be reproducible.

Law 12 — Purpose must not drift.

An agent cannot deviate from the mission set at birth.

5. Governance Roles
A.IV.E Core (Root Governor)

Full authority over:

birth

death

reproduction

compliance

escalation

revocation

Domain Supervisors

Authority to:

rate clarity

assess outputs

grant domain approvals

Agents

Authority to:

perform assigned capabilities

teach (if allowed)

request upgrades

6. Governance Audit Model

Agents must undergo audits on the following intervals:

Compliance Class	Audit Interval
A (Observer)	90 days
B (Analyst)	60 days
C (Predictor)	45 days
D (Advisor)	30 days
E (Teacher)	14 days
F (Evolutionary)	7 days

Audit includes:

clarity score trends

prediction accuracy

deviation detection

reasoning consistency

ethical compliance

7. Evolution Governance

Evolution requires:

clarity ≥ 80

stability ≥ 70

domain supervisor approval

A.I.V.E core signature

issuance of a Revised Birth Certificate

This is how you build a self-evolving agent ecosystem safely.
