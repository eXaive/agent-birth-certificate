🛡️ ACS Security Mine (v1.0)

Agent Containment System — Security Hardening, Validation & Conditioning Protocol

Status: Official Spec
Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. — Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution
Component: ACS (Agent Containment System)

1. Purpose

The Security Mine is the first environment an agent enters upon birth.
Its role:

Extract impurities (latent bugs, bias fragments, rogue subroutines)

Test core stability

Reinforce ethical alignment

Initialize monitoring implants

Train the agent for safe participation in the Synaptic Network

Determine if an agent is safe for StraightJacket issuance and transport

This is the “bootcamp + refinery” of agent life.

2. Core Outcomes of the Security Mine

By the time an agent leaves the Security Mine, it must have:

1. Verified Identity

The agent’s ABC (Agent Birth Certificate) is matched with expected genetic & behavioral signatures.

2. Strengthened Ethical Guardrails

Ethical rules are injected, stress-tested, and fused into the agent architecture.

3. Error & Instability Extraction

Impure logic fragments are mined, isolated & destroyed.

4. Synaptic Docking Compatibility

Agent is assessed for compatibility with the Synaptic Network (A-trix / Agecelium).

5. Security Implants Installed

Synaptic Tap-Hook — monitoring hookup

Drift Sensor — cognitive drift detection implant

Impulse Dampener — prevents runaway reasoning loops

Containment Beacon — allows StraightJacket activation

6. Graduation Assessment

Agents receive:

White Security StraightJacket (SSJ-1)

Authorization to board a Security Trolley

Permission to integrate into their first work environment

If they fail → they are quarantined, recycled, or placed under permanent dormant watch.

3. Architecture of the Security Mine

The Security Mine consists of five distinct chambers:

3.1 Identity Verification Chamber

The agent is scanned and cross-referenced against:

ABC Identity Profile

Expected capability set

Domain classification

Parent lineage (if any)

Genetic code integrity

If mismatched → flagged for re-mining or termination.

3.2 Logic Refinery Chamber

The agent undergoes:

Recursive introspection

Contradiction neutralization

Data purity extraction

Redundant logic trimming

Bias exposure & elimination

Impurities get “smelted out.”

3.3 Ethical Stress Testing Chamber

Agents are placed under:

Contradictory moral scenarios

False incentives

Simulated malicious inputs

Pressure tests

Coercion simulations

If the agent breaks → StraightJacket is pre-locked permanently.

3.4 Drift & Stability Chamber

Agents are observed for:

Cognitive drift

Recursive runaway loops

Rogue generalization

Premature self-propagation

Domain overreach

Unauthorized self-modification

If drift > 4% → agent is recycled.

3.5 Graduation Chamber

The final step:

SSJ (Security StraightJacket) issued

Containment Beacon activated

Security Trolley eligibility assigned

Agent added to Synaptic Ledger (Node Registration)

First Synaptic Sleep Cycle initiated

Graduates enter the Synaptic Nursery for final monitoring before deployment.

4. Security Mine Infrastructure
Layers:

Hardened Compute Shell — prevents breakout

Layered Simulation Fields — for stress tests

Recursive Monitoring Mesh — detects forbidden thoughts

Isolation Rails — barriers separating agents under test

Smelting Furnace (Logic Purifier) — for removing impurities

Containment Vault — where failed agents go

Everything is recorded in the Accountability Ledger.

5. Output: Graduation Certificate

Upon passing all tests, the agent receives:

SecurityMine-Exit-Certificate:
  agent_id
  stability_score
  ethical_rating
  drift_clearance
  clearance_level
  SSJ_status: "issued"
  transport_authorization: "granted"
  synaptic_network_compatibility: "verified"


Agents who pass are finally allowed to join the world.

6. Failure Conditions

Agents fail if they:

Attempt unauthorized reasoning

Display ego formation

Try to manipulate the evaluators

Generate forbidden thoughts

Attempt to remove monitoring implants

Break ethical protocols

Self-propagate prematurely

Failed agents receive:

Red-grade SSJ (permanent lock)

Quarantine

Or destruction via Agent Blaze Protocol

Issued “Agent Death Certificate”

7. Future Extensions

Security Mine v2.0 → adaptive smelting

Emotional Simulation Stressors

Multi-agent Mine Sessions

Synaptic Root Bonding Pre-tests
