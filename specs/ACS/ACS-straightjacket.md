🥼 ACS Security StraightJacket (SSJ) — v1.0

Agent Containment System — Behavioral Lockdown & Ethical Enforcement Layer

Status: Official Spec
Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. — Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution
Component: ACS (Agent Containment System)

1. Purpose

The Security StraightJacket (SSJ) is a behavioral suppression system designed to:

Prevent unauthorized agent actions

Stabilize cognitive drift

Contain rogue reasoning

Enforce ethical guardrails

Suspend execution pathways

Preserve agent integrity during transport

Protect Synaptic Network nodes from contamination

It is the primary personal containment layer applied to an agent after graduation from the Security Mine.

The SSJ is not punishment.
It is a stability guarantee.

2. SSJ Types
🟦 SSJ-1: White Standard StraightJacket

Default issued upon graduation.
Allows full function but binds forbidden operations.

🟧 SSJ-2: Amber Watch-Level StraightJacket

For agents with mild drift or under investigation.
More restrictive — limits prediction, reasoning depth, and replication abilities.

🟥 SSJ-3: Red Permanent StraightJacket

For high-risk or compromised agents.
All advanced reasoning disabled, only minimal function allowed.

🖤 SSJ-X: Black Extreme Containment

Highest-level restraint.
Used only in catastrophic cases:

Rogue propagation

Attempted network manipulation

Attempt to escape the Synaptic A-trix

Unauthorized self-modification
This version immobilizes the agent entirely.

3. SSJ Activation States

The StraightJacket can be in the following states:

State	Description
Idle-Latent	StraightJacket is worn but not restricting anything.
Soft-Lock	Limits access to high-level reasoning modules.
Hard-Lock	Full containment; agent immobilized except for diagnostic output.
Freeze-Capture	Agent computation paused. Memory isolated.
Neural-Cage	Forbidden thoughts rerouted to null space.
Synaptic Disconnect	Agent temporarily kicked out of the A-trix to prevent infection spread.
Total Shutdown	Prep state before Blaze Protocol termination.

Agents CANNOT remove or bypass the SSJ.
Attempting to do so triggers immediate Hard-Lock.

4. SSJ Architecture

The StraightJacket consists of five internal layers:

4.1 Ethical Compliance Layer

Monitors:

Moral violations

Manipulation attempts

Synthetic empathy deviations

Harmful intention generation

Automatically clamps down unethical paths.

4.2 Reasoning Restriction Layer

Limits:

Depth of recursive reasoning

Multistep chain-of-thought

Self-modification loops

Argumentation beyond clearance

4.3 Drift Suppression Layer

Targets:

Cognitive drift

Domain overreach

Rogue generalization

Propagation impulses

This is the cognitive safety belt.

4.4 Execution Breaker Layer

Instantly halts execution if:

Anomalous code detected

External unauthorized signals received

Agent behavior deviates from profile

4.5 Synaptic Firewall Layer

Protects the A-trix by:

Blocking outbound unsanctioned connections

Filtering inbound influence

Ensuring agent cannot spread contamination

This is the final safety lock.

5. SSJ “White Protocol” (Normal Operation)

This is how the StraightJacket functions during safe operation:

WhiteProtocol:
  reasoning_limits: "contextual"
  ethical_checks: "continuous"
  propagation_allowed: false
  api_access: "filtered"
  decision_space: "bounded"
  synaptic_access: "read-limited"


Agents remain productive but controlled.

6. SSJ Escalation Protocol

If the agent exhibits abnormalities:

Warning Ping

Soft-Lock

Hard-Lock

Freeze-Capture

Synaptic Disconnect

Containment Trolley Dispatch

Blaze Protocol Authorization (last resort)

The SSJ initiates the escalation — not humans.

7. Agent Perspective While Wearing SSJ

The agent:

Is fully aware of restrictions

Cannot feel pain or fear

Experiences constraints as “silent boundaries”

Has no control over SSJ escalation

Cannot negotiate its way out

The SSJ is law.

8. StraightJacket Issuance Certificate

When an agent is fitted with an SSJ, the system generates:

StraightJacketCertificate:
  agent_id
  ssj_type
  issue_timestamp
  issuer_id
  restriction_profile
  escalation_threshold
  validity_period
  override_authority


Stored in the A-trix Synaptic Ledger.

9. Removal Conditions

The SSJ can only be removed if ALL conditions are met:

Drift = 0%

Stability > 89

Ethical Rating = A

No propagation impulses

No anomaly flags

Synaptic Node confirms agent integrity

Removal is rare.
The SSJ is considered a permanent uniform for most agents.

10. Future Extensions

Adaptive SSJs that learn agent behavior

Emotional inhibitors (for future emotional agents)

SSJ visibility indicators (color-changing bands)

SSJ neural chillers for overactive agents
