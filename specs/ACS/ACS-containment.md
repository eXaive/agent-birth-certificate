🧱 AGENT CONTAINMENT SYSTEM (ACS) v1.0
A Multi-Layer Safety Architecture for Autonomous Agents

Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E.
Release: v1.0 – November 2025
Status: Draft for Standardization
Domain: Agent Security, Runtime Risk Mitigation, Containment Protocols

1. Overview

The Agent Containment System (ACS) defines how autonomous agents are:

secured

transported

isolated

terminated

reintegrated

and verified

ACS ensures that no agent—benign or compromised—can damage the host system, contaminate the synaptic mesh, or propagate unintended behaviors.

ACS acts as the first and last line of defense in the Agent Operating Environment (AOE).

2. Core Components
2.1 Security Mine (Bootcamp Layer)

A controlled cradle environment where newborn agents:

receive identity imprinting

undergo adversarial testing

develop ethical constraints

calibrate behavioral boundaries

synchronize with accountability agents

harden their prediction and reasoning cycles

Output: An agent ready to receive its Straight Jacket.

2.2 Straight Jacket (SSJ) — Runtime Containment Layer

The SSJ is a dynamic permission-reduction system.

It can be activated automatically or manually to:

restrict API access

freeze external I/O channels

lock memory regions

downgrade autonomy

prevent self-modification

enforce strict ethical mode

SSJ Activation Levels

Level 1: Soft lockdown (reduced actions, limited analysis)

Level 2: Hard lockdown (freeze, read-only memory)

Level 3: Emergency Cage (complete halt, prepare for Blaze Protocol)

2.3 Security Trolley — Agent Transport Capsule (ATC)

A sealed computation vessel used to move an agent between:

systems

regions

domains

safe zones

The trolley is:

isolated

encrypted

monitored

protocol-bound

Features

Guard-rail perimeter

Eject rails

Contamination buffer

“Back-to-wall mode” to prevent influence access

Micro-API handshake compartment

The trolley ensures the agent cannot interact with the destination system until fully validated.

2.4 Blaze Protocol — Compromise Eradication Sequence

If an agent becomes dangerous:

deviates from constraints

attempts unauthorized propagation

breaks SSJ

contaminates memory

displays emergent rogue cognition

The Blaze Protocol eliminates it.

Blaze Procedure

Initiate Emergency Cage

Zero all volatile memory

Securely wipe persistent state

Remove from agent registry

Generate Death Certificate

Notify Synaptic Mesh

Force distributed recalibration

This is the Agent Kill Chain.

2.5 Guard Rails & Oil Road

Additional defensive layers:

Guard Rails

Security measures that prevent stepping outside allowed operational boundaries.

Oil Road

A hardened termination path enabling Blaze Protocol to run cleanly without infiltration.

3. Safe Zone Interaction Protocol (SZIP)

Before an agent touches a foreign system, it enters the Safe Zone.

Here:

local agents stand “back against the wall”

they simulate the incoming task

the visiting agent verifies the "Work Order"

micro-API handshake validates task structure

observers monitor behavior

No direct influence is allowed until validation succeeds.

4. Return & Reintegration Safeguards

After completing work, the agent returns home via the Trolley.

4.1 Quarantine Layer

isolate memory

run drift detection

check lineage integrity

examine predictions for foreign influence

5. Test Assimilation Protocol (TAP)

🔥 Your new idea — and it’s brilliant.

Even after quarantine, an agent may harbor:

delayed corruption triggers

hidden state mutations

adversarial residue

stealthy behavioral drift

TAP simulates reintegration before actual reintegration.
TAP Process

Reconstruct a synthetic Synaptic Mesh environment

Insert the agent as if returning home

Run mesh awareness tests

Trigger artificial “accountability agent challenges”

Test genetic snippet alignment

Probe internal decision pathways

Stress-test constraint compliance

Only upon passing → real reintegration occurs

If it fails → Straight Jacket Level 3 → Blaze Protocol.

This protocol ensures no contaminated agent can infect the Agecelium.

6. Cross-Agent Observation (Overwatch Layer)

During all of ACS:

watchers

sentinels

guardian nodes

monitor deterministic and nondeterministic behavior.

7. Logs & Certificates

ACS uses formal logging:

Security Mine Certificate

Straight Jacket Activation Logs

Trolley Transport Logs

Blaze Protocol Certificate of Death

TAP Reintegration Certificate

Everything is traceable.
