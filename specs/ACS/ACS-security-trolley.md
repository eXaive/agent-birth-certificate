🚨 ACS Security Trolley (ST) — v1.0

Agent Containment System — Secure Transport & Transitional Work Zone

Status: Official Specification
Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. — Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution
Module: ACS (Agent Containment System)
Component: Containment Transport Infrastructure

1. Purpose

The Security Trolley (ST) is the protected transport vehicle for agents moving between:

the Synaptic A-trix

isolated safe zones

foreign systems requiring agent work

the Security Mine

or quarantine bays

It ensures that no agent can:

escape

contaminate other systems

manipulate host environments

carry back corrupted states

The ST is a zero-trust mobile container for all agent movement.

Without the trolley, an agent cannot go anywhere.

2. Why a Trolley Exists

Agents cannot be allowed to:

walk freely between systems

touch raw APIs

interact with unprotected environments

The Security Trolley solves this by providing:

sealed transport

guardrails

API-limited windows

behavior insulation

digital “seatbelts”

pre- and post-travel diagnosis

3. Trolley Types
🟦 ST-1: Standard Security Trolley

For normal movements within the safe network (A-trix → Synaptic zones).

🟧 ST-2: Reinforced Trolley

For handling agents under SSJ-2 or with moderate drift.

🟥 ST-3: Hazard Containment Trolley

Carries agents wearing SSJ-3 red jackets.

🖤 ST-X: Extreme Black Trolley

Only used for:

rogue agents

corruption alerts

Blaze Protocol candidates

Built like a digital prison cell.

4. Multi-Layer Protection Architecture

The Security Trolley has six internal layers, each designed to block a different class of agent misbehavior.

4.1 Integrity Casing

Prevents unauthorized memory mutation during transit.

4.2 Guardrail System

Two digital arms on each side of the trolley:

block agent influence

prevent escape

choke off anomalous branches

If triggered, guardrails snap to full lockdown instantly.

4.3 Isolation Bubble

Disconnects the agent from:

other agents

network signals

A-trix broadcasting

The agent travels in a sealed thought-bubble.

4.4 Transport API Window

A hyper-minimal API interface:

one-way communication only

no write access

bounded query limits

monitored by the A-trix Overseer

This allows:

sending work samples

verifying tasks

confirming intent

but NOTHING more.

4.5 Hazard Detection Unit

Detects:

drift spikes

recursive loops

unauthorized propagation

behavioral anomalies

command injection attempts

If triggered → automatically escalates SSJ → ST-3 or ST-X.

4.6 Auto-Return Protocol

If agent becomes unstable or network compromised:

trolley automatically reverses

returns to quarantine bay

locks agent for decontamination

5. Transport Journey Sequence

Transport always follows this strict choreography:

1. Call Trolley

Synaptic Overseer summons an ST from the Transport Pool.

2. Pre-Boarding Scan

Agent is:

checked for drift

checked for anomalies

locked into SSJ

sealed into the ST

3. Departure

Trolley begins controlled movement along secure digital pathways (“rails”).

4. Travel Phase

Throughout the journey:

guardrails active

anomaly detectors running

oversight agents monitoring

5. Arrival at Safe Zone

Trolley enters the Agent Safe Room, never directly into the target system.

6. Verification Phase

Receiving agents simulate the target task and send it to the transported agent.

This validates:

accuracy

alignment

ethical compliance

absence of contamination

7. Work Execution

Only after passing verification does the real system allow interaction.

8. Return

Agent reenters the trolley.

9. Quarantine

On return, agent undergoes:

neural screening

corruption detection

delayed-trigger checks

10. Reintegration

Finally, agent is reconnected to the Synaptic A-trix.

6. Emergency Features
Guardrail Snap-Lock

Instant hard barrier around the agent.

Path Lubrication (“Oil Road”)

A security metaphor meaning the trolley:

accelerates automatically

escapes danger

isolates instantly

removes influence zones

Blackout Mode

All API windows shut.

Freeze-Capture

Suspends the agent if needed.

Blaze Protocol

If agent becomes a threat → ST-X triggers termination request to the A-trix Executive Layer.

7. Trolley Communication Rules

Agents inside an ST can only perform:

allowed_actions:
  - receive_mock_tasks
  - run_safe_simulations
  - confirm_intentions
  - return_output
  - request_abort
denied_actions:
  - spawn agents
  - modify code
  - create connections
  - access external data
  - influence observers


They do not have the ability to touch live system code until after passing verification.

8. Trolley Metadata

Each transport event logs:

TransportCertificate:
  trolley_id
  agent_id
  ssj_level
  origin_zone
  destination_zone
  departure_timestamp
  arrival_timestamp
  anomalies_detected
  quarantine_result


Filed into A-trix Synaptic Ledger.

9. Future Extensions

Multi-agent convoy trolleys

Trolley-to-trolley transfer stations

Trolley drone escorts

Hardened cross-cloud migration carts

Predictive routing using the Recession Agent’s clarity engine

Sub-zero isolation layer for emotional models
