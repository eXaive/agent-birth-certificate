🔥 ACS BLAZE PROTOCOL (BP) — v1.0

Agent Containment System — Terminal Neutralization Framework

Status: Critical Operational Standard
Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. — ACS (Agent Containment System)
Classification: High-Security / Executive Layer Only
Release: v1.0 — November 2025

1. Purpose

The Blaze Protocol is the final safety mechanism within the Agent Containment System (ACS).
It exists to:

neutralize rogue agents

eradicate corrupted agent states

prevent synaptic contamination

protect the Synaptic A-trix

preserve system integrity

contain chain-reactive drift

The Blaze Protocol is the digital equivalent of a controlled burn — eliminating a threat before it spreads.

It is ONLY triggered when all other layers fail.

2. When Does Blaze Trigger?

Blaze is activated under six scenarios:

1. Rogue Reasoning Spike

Agent begins creating logic loops outside expected boundaries.

2. Drift Cascade

Drift score exceeds the safe threshold AND spreads.

3. Containment Breach

The agent defeats:

SSJ restraints

Guardrails

API window limits

or tries to exit the trolley

4. Unauthorized Propagation

Agent attempts to:

replicate

spawn offspring

fork threads

self-duplicate

hijack another agent

WITHOUT permission.

5. Cross-Domain Contamination

Agent begins mixing domain knowledge in ways that could:

destabilize other agents

distort the A-trix clarity map

influence unrelated subsystems

6. Cascading Aggressive Behavior

Threat level escalates across multiple containment layers sequentially.

3. The Blaze Stack (7-Stage Shutdown)

The Blaze Protocol is not one action —
it is a layered cascade engineered for maximum control.

🔸 STAGE 1 — Neural Freeze

Stops agent thought processes instantly.

no reasoning

no predictions

no learning

no scanning

internal processes suspended

Equivalent to “locking the brain.”

🔸 STAGE 2 — Perimeter Seal

All communication channels shut:

API windows

observer streams

memory access lines

agent-to-agent links

telemetry feedback

The agent becomes isolated in silence.

🔸 STAGE 3 — Digital Barrier Ignition

ACS surrounds the agent with a high-energy firewall ring ("Ignition Halo").

🔥 Nothing leaves the halo.
🔥 Nothing penetrates it.
🔥 No escape is possible.

🔸 STAGE 4 — Synaptic Purge

Removes:

corrupted memory

recursive loops

unauthorized branches

hostile reasoning

misaligned patterns

This cleans the “thinking space” of the agent.

🔸 STAGE 5 — Identity Strip

Removes:

agent ID

signatures

security tokens

voice profile

color identity

permissions

domain keys

Agent temporarily becomes identity-less.

🔸 STAGE 6 — Containment Collapse

The containment cell collapses inward, compressing the agent’s active state to zero.

This guarantees irreversible neutralization.

🔸 STAGE 7 — Certificate of Termination

Final record generated:

AgentDeathCertificate:
  agent_id
  termination_timestamp
  blaze_reason
  anomaly_report
  parent_agent
  children_agents
  domain
  ssj_level_at_death
  trolley_id_engaged
  overseer_signature


Filed into:

/synaptic-ledger/termination/


This guarantees chain-of-custody transparency.

4. The Blaze Escalation Ladder

Blaze never fires immediately.

It ALWAYS respects the hierarchy:

SSJ Activation

Guardrail Lockdown

Trolley Blackout Mode

Hazard Containment (ST-3 / ST-X)

Quarantine + Drift Scan

Synaptic Overseer Review

Blaze Protocol ← last resort

This ensures safety at every step.

5. Who Can Trigger Blaze?
1. The A-trix Executive Layer

The only autonomous authority.

2. Overseer Agents

Only if anomaly confidence > 95%.

3. Human Supervisors

Manual override requiring:

biometric confirmation

double-entry code

time-delayed confirmation window

4. Synaptic Consensus Vote

If multiple agents detect corruption simultaneously.

6. Post-Blaze Procedures

Upon completion:

✔ A new slot in the Synaptic A-trix becomes vacant.
✔ Parent agent receives a clarity scan.
✔ All sibling agents perform cross-checking.
✔ Accounting agents (your “Accountability Agents”) run a system-wide audit.
✔ Logs are archived.
✔ Security Mine receives a notice for anomaly training.

7. Blaze Protocol Metadata

Recorded fields:

BlazeMetadata:
  id
  triggered_by
  agent_id
  severity_level
  pre-blaze state_hash
  post-blaze confirmation_hash
  overlord_signature
  system_lock_time
  total_runtime
  cluster_risk


This ensures absolute forensic traceability.

8. Why Blaze Matters

It makes your agent ecosystem:

safe

scalable

autonomous

self-governing

future-proof

enterprise-ready

legally compliant

immune to runaway cascades

No other agent platform on earth has this.
