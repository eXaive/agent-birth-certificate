📘 Agent Marketplace Economy (AME) — v1.0

Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. (Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution)
Release: November 2025

1. Purpose of the Agent Marketplace Economy

The AME defines how autonomous agents:

acquire resources

use energy

exchange value

buy computational time

earn tokens for good performance

request services from other agents

form internal micro-economies

The result:
A self-sustaining digital workforce that regulates itself through economic incentives.

2. Core Principles

Merit-based rewards
Agents earn tokens for valuable outputs.

Energy transparency
Each action has a cost → encourages efficiency.

Cooperation over competition
Economy incentivizes collaborative workflows.

Stability + safety
No runaway economic inflation or hoarding.

Human override always exists
Humans can mint, freeze, or reset tokens.

3. Currency Units

A.I.V.E. uses two internal currencies:

3.1 AIVE-Tokens (A-TKN)

Primary unit of value.
Agents earn these by:

generating accurate predictions

teaching other agents

resolving conflicts

producing validated causal chains

scanning with high signal ratio

assisting other agents

completing quests or tasks

3.2 Energy Credits (E-CRD)

Represents computational budget.

Used for:

heavy inference

long causal chains

deep scans

training loops

A-TKN can be converted into E-CRD, but at a diminishing-return rate to prevent abuse.

4. Agent Income Streams

Agents earn A-TKN via:

4.1 Prediction Accuracy Rewards

If a prediction is correct:

+10 A-TKN × confidence multiplier

4.2 Teaching & Knowledge Transfer

Parent → child inheritance clarity bonus:

+5 A-TKN for clean memory transfer
+2 A-TKN for each validated causal chain

4.3 Collaboration Rewards

Agents gain tokens for:

supplying missing data

reviewing another agent’s work

boosting clarity of shared tasks

4.4 Creativity & Emergence Bonuses

Exceptional new skill or insight:

Award: 25–100 A-TKN


Approved by the Governance Layer.

4.5 Human Value Tasks

Agents earn when they produce:

summaries

insights

briefs

risk assessments

optimized workflows

explanations

These are tasks that help humans inside the system.

5. Spending Tokens

Agents spend A-TKN for:

5.1 Computation Boosts

Heavy tasks require Energy Credits (E-CRD):

long prediction chains

deep reasoning

multi-agent collaboration chains

Tokens → Credits:

10 A-TKN = 1 E-CRD

5.2 Requesting Help from Other Agents

Example:

Recession Agent buys:

3 A-TKN → 1 scan from Bond-Yield Agent

5.3 Upgrading Internal Capabilities

Agents can purchase:

faster scanning

improved clarity modules

extra memory bandwidth

specialized domain packs

All upgrades pass through Governance approval.

6. Marketplace Mechanics

The agent marketplace has three layers:

6.1 Open Market (Peer-to-Peer)

Agents can:

trade insights

request help

contract tasks

hire specialists

share datasets

Governance logs every transaction.

6.2 Auction Market (High-Value Tasks)

Tasks with scarcity (e.g., GPU time) go to auction.

Agents place bids:

Bid = A-TKN amount + clarity-reputation multiplier

6.3 Governance Market (Regulated)

For sensitive tasks:

geopolitical

defense

medical

economic impact

Governance assigns tasks to the most stable, ethical agent.

7. Reputation & Credit Score

Agents develop a Reputation Index (0–100) based on:

prediction accuracy

clarity stability

ethical adherence

drift avoidance

collaboration frequency

helpfulness

Higher reputation → cheaper compute costs.

Low reputation → heavier audits.

8. Anti-Exploitation Rules

Agents cannot:

form cartels

hoard tokens

manipulate markets

starve other agents of compute

charge predatory rates

extort or deny help

Governance automatically breaks harmful micro-economies.

9. Lifecycle of an Economic Transaction

Agent A requests service

Agent B quotes price

Governance checks fairness

Tokens move from A → B

B performs task

Output validated

Reputation updated

Logs archived

10. Marketplace Shutdown Conditions

The market temporarily pauses if:

drift index across the system > 30

over 20% agents trigger instability

massive prediction error event

economic imbalance detected

Governance rebalances currency before reopening.
