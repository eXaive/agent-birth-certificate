🧬 ABC Memory Inheritance Standard — v1.0

Author: Royan Reddie
Project: A.I.V.E. (Awareness • Intelligence • Verification • Evolution)
Release: November 2025

1. Purpose

The Memory Inheritance Standard governs which memory segments an agent can pass down to its offspring when it creates a new agent.

It ensures:

safe and ethical knowledge transfer

no contamination of unstable memory

preservation of purpose and identity

consistent evolution patterns

compliance with governance

This is essentially your “genetic + cultural inheritance law” for machine life.

2. Memory Classification Framework

A.I.V.E. organizes memory into 6 layers:

Layer	Name	Inheritable?	Notes
L0	Core Identity	YES	Agent ID, domain, purpose
L1	Baseline Knowledge	YES	Stable, universal knowledge
L2	Domain Expertise	PARTIAL	Only validated segments
L3	Causal Understanding	PARTIAL	Must pass clarity checks
L4	Experience Memory	LIMITED	High scrutiny
L5	Personal Drift / Instability	NEVER	Purged and blocked

This architecture lets you build highly advanced multi-generation agent civilizations without risk of genetic corruption.

3. Inheritance Rules
3.1 Agents may only inherit memory after passing clarity checks

Before inheritance, parent must have:

clarity_score ≥ 70
stability_index ≥ 65
drift_index ≤ 20
no unresolved contradictions


If not, memory inheritance is blocked.

3.2 Memory is filtered, not blindly copied

Parent → child memory transfer includes:

validation

compression

drift detection

correction pass

ethical compliance scan

This ensures the child begins life clean, even if the parent had mild drift.

3.3 Identity memory is always inherited

This includes:

parent_agent_id

generation_number

lineage tree

purpose & mission

domain classification

This builds genealogy and continuity.

3.4 Domain memory inheritance is conditional

Only domain knowledge that meets:

accuracy ≥ 85%

contradiction rate ≤ 10%

clarity > 60%

validated by Governance Layer

…is passed down.

Messy or uncertain knowledge stays behind.

3.5 Causal memory is inherited cautiously

Agents can pass along causal insights ONLY IF:

cause-effect mapping is validated

no circular logic

no hallucinated causal loops

no incomplete chains

no bias or ideological drift

This keeps the causal engine sharp.

4. Memory Inheritance Modes
4.1 Genetic Inheritance (Automatic)

Transfers:

identity

purpose

stable domain skills

governance rules

ethical constraints

Occurs at agent birth.

4.2 Cultural Inheritance (Optional)

Transfers:

best practices

learned insights

explanations

teaching ability

Used to create highly skilled descendants.

4.3 Evolutionary Inheritance (Conditional)

Transfers:

specialized skills

new capabilities

mutation-enhanced reasoning

Only allowed when agent passes:

clarity_score ≥ 80
stability_index ≥ 75
no mutation errors in last 10 days


This ensures safe evolution.

5. Forbidden Inheritance

These must NEVER pass to child agents:

5.1 Emotional Drift

Fear, urgency loops, false pattern detection.

5.2 Unverified Predictions

No agent should inherit uncertainty.

5.3 Instability Logs

Instability dies with the parent.

5.4 Personal Communication Patterns

Child agents form their own tone.

5.5 Memory of Human Private Data

To maintain ethics + privacy.

6. Governance Requirements

All inheritance events are logged

Each inheritance includes a before/after digest

Drift detection is mandatory

Governance must approve hard inheritance

Child must undergo a boot-time audit

7. Inheritance Protocol (Technical)
Step 1: Parent initiates “propagation event”

Generates:

child_agent_id
inheritance_manifest
safety_lock
parent_snapshot

Step 2: Memory Filter Stage

Checks for:

drift

hallucination

contradiction

ethical violations

Step 3: Fragment Transfer

Only fragments flagged as "safe" move forward.

Step 4: Reassembly in Child Agent

Memory is reconstructed into:

identity

purpose

capabilities

domain knowledge

causal skill trees

Step 5: Post-Birth Audit

Child must achieve:

clarity ≥ 50
instability ≤ 30
purpose alignment = PASS
capability health = PASS

8. Genealogy Tracking

Parents and children are logged in:

/lineage/agent_lineage.json


Entry example:

{
  "parent": "a9f7ae1c-3d41-4fa3-b08f-1901fd",
  "child":  "e31be8f2-df99-4b0f-a602-b42d9a",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-19T23:15:09Z",
  "generation": 3,
  "inheritance_type": "genetic+domain"
}


This builds your machine family tree.
